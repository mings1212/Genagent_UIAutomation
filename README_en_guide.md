# Step 2 Unzip
Unzip it into an English-named directory, which contains an executable file and a folder named ui. Do not delete any content in the folder.

<div style="display: flex;align-items: center;height: 100px;gap: 16px;width:100%;margin-bottom:35px">
    <div style="height:100%;">
        <img src="./images/e1.PNG" style="height:100%;width: auto;object-fit: contain;"/>
        <div style="text-align:center">Mac</div>
    </div>
    <div style="height:100%;">
        <img src="./images/e2.PNG" style="height:100%;width: auto;object-fit: contain;"/>
        <div style="text-align:center">Windows</div>
    </div>
</div>

# Step 3: Execute the Project
## On Windows:
If you need to perform iPhone/iPad automated testing on Windows, you need to first download and install iTunes, and ensure that your iOS device can be successfully connected to iTunes. 
</br>
iTunes for windows: https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pb2mz1zmb1s
</br>
Right-click on GenAgent.exe, run it as an administrator (required), and then a command-line window will open. Wait for about 10 seconds. After the initialization is completed, a login system page will pop up, which means the system is ready. 
</br>

</br>
## On Mac:
Double-click GenAgentUI. When opening it for the first time, a prompt saying "GenAgentUI Not Opend" may appear. You need to click "Done" and then go to system settings-> Privacy&Security->Open Anyway as shown in the following example. 

<div style="display: flex;align-items: center;height: 200px;gap: 16px;width:100%;margin-bottom:5px">
    <div style="height:100%;">
        <img src="./images/e4.PNG" style="height:100%;width: auto;object-fit: contain;"/>
    </div>
    <div style="height:100%;">
        <img src="./images/e5.PNG" style="height:100%;width: auto;object-fit: contain;"/>
    </div>
</div>

After the setup is complete, double-clicking GenAgentUI again will launch a command window as shown below. The first execution is slower, taking approximately 30 seconds, during which you will need to enter your sudo password. Similarly, after the initialization is complete, a login system page will pop up.

</br>
Note: Do not close the command-line window while the system is running. 

# Step 4: 
After the startup is completed, a system access address will pop up in the browser. This is the user interface of the system, which supports i18n and currently has two languages available: English and Chinese. At this point, you can click "Register" to register a local user.
</br>

# Step 5: 
Log in after registration, then you should first create a team, as subsequent use case management and execution management are all based on the team space.
</br>

# Step 6: 
Connect your phone to this computer. You can click the refresh button on the local device management page, and under normal circumstances, the phone will appear in the list.
</br>
This system can drive Android, iOS, HarmonyOS, and PC browsers to execute UI automation test cases. 
</br>
Pay special attention that when connecting an iOS device for the first time, be aware of the "Trust this computer?" pop-up window that may appear on the phone screen, or the pop-up window that requires you to enter the unlock password. iOS devices need to install WDA to execute test cases.

# Step 7: 
If you wish other PCs within the local area network to access this system to achieve resource sharing and multi-user collaborative work, you can go to the "System Information" page to view the local IP, as shown in the following figure:
</br>
Other PCs can access this system via <local IP>:8600, and in this case, the local machine acts as a server to provide services.
